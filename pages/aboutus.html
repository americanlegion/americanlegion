                <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
                In the spirit of service, not self, the mission of the American Legion Auxiliary is to support The American Legion and to honor the sacrifice of those who serve by enhancing the lives of our veterans, military, and their families, both at home and abroad. For God and Country, we advocate for veterans, educate our citizens, mentor youth, and promote patriotism, good citizenship, peace and security.
                <h3>Vision Statement</h3>
                The vision of the American Legion Auxiliary is to support The American Legion while becoming the premier service organization and foundation of every community providing support for our veterans, our military, and their families by shaping a positive future in an atmosphere of fellowship, patriotism, peach and security.
                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                The vision of the American Legion Auxiliary is to support The American Legion while becoming the premier service organization and foundation of every community providing support for our veterans, our military, and their families by shaping a positive future in an atmosphere of fellowship, patriotism, peach and security.
                <h4>Fun Facts</h4>
                <ul>The Auxiliary and the Legion are often centers for community and civic activities in mid-America, and provide a focal point for citizens' involvement.</ul>
                <ul>The Auxiliary raises more than $18 million every year and reinvests those funds in VA medical centers and community programs.</ul>
                <ul>Thousands of hours are devoted to crime prevention programs, instructing children, the elderly and the general public on safety, crime prevention and protection within the community.</ul>
                <ul>Auxiliary volunteers are the backbone of assistance in the 171 VA Medical Centers.</ul>
                <ul>They not only provide diversion and entertainment for patients, but assist the hospital staff in physical and psychological therapy, clerical and many other duties that would otherwise cost American taxpayers millions of dollars.</ul>
                <ul>The Auxiliary deals with issues such as drug and alcohol abuse, missing and abused children, teen suicide and teen pregnancy. Its services touch the lives of all Americans directly or indirectly.</ul>
                <ul>More than 20 nationwide programs receive support and financial aid from the American Legion Auxiliary.</ul>
                </p>
                <h3>The President's Theme &amp; Symbol</h3>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="/images/pressymbol.JPG" alt=""></br>
                “Honoring Our Veterans – Past, Present and Future!” is the theme selected for our 2015-2016 Auxiliary year. I am thrilled to be working with you all this year to make our organization strong and sustainable for future generations! Together we can and must achieve this goal or we will not be here into the future for our veterans of yesterday, today and tomorrow. We MUST embrace our membership challenge and grow our organization or who will be here to serve our veterans? It’s going to be a terrific year for TEAM IOWA! You are all Super Stars!</br></br>

                The symbol I selected is red, white and blue stars which I hope you have a lot of fun with.</br></br>

                Focus songs for the year are: “This is My Country”, “You’re a Grand Old Flag”, “When you Wish Upon a Star”, “Stars &amp; Stripes Forever”, “If I Can Dream”, “Unsinkable Ships” and “Surely the Presence of the Lord is in this Place”</br></br>

                Selected scripture is “1 Corinthians 13:4-8”</br>
                Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.</br></br>

                Awards and incentives are many this year as you document your activities throughout the year, be sure to submit your narratives before April 30 to the appropriate Department Chairman. Department American Legion Auxiliary website ia.legion.org/ala and the National American Legion Auxiliary website www.alaforveterans.org are a wealth of information and resources.</br></br>

                Again, I look forward to a wonderful year with TEAM IOWA! Thank you for your service!
